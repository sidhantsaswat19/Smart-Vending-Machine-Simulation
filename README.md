# Smart-Vending-Machine-Simulation

**Smart Vending Machine Simulation** | Java, Design Patterns, State Logic

**Architected a state-driven vending system** utilizing the **Singleton Pattern** to manage a centralized, persistent inventory instance, ensuring consistent stock tracking across machine lifecycles.

**Implemented a custom persistence layer** using **Java Serialization** to automatically snapshot inventory state (beans, milk, syrup) to disk after every transaction, ensuring 100% data retention across restarts.

**Designed a flexible product architecture** using **Polymorphism** and **Inheritance**, decoupling specific coffee recipes (Espresso, Latte) from the core transaction engine to facilitate dynamic menu scaling.
